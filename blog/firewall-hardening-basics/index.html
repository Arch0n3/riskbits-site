    <p>Your firewall is the front door to your network. A misconfigured firewall is like a lock that's never been tested — it looks secure, but it might not actually stop anyone.</p>
    
    <p>I've reviewed hundreds of firewall configs over the years. These are the hardening steps that actually matter, regardless of whether you're running Cisco, Fortinet, Palo Alto, pfSense, or something else.</p>

    <h2>The Fundamentals (Non-Negotiable)</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Default Deny</h3>
    <p>Your firewall should block everything by default and only allow what's explicitly permitted. This sounds obvious, but I still find configs where the implicit rule is "permit any any" or there's no cleanup rule at the end.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Disable Unused Interfaces</h3>
    <p>If a physical or logical interface isn't in use, disable it. Don't just leave it unconfigured — explicitly shut it down.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Change Default Credentials</h3>
    <p>Yes, people still forget this. Admin/admin, admin/password, blank passwords on console access. Check and change them.</p>

    <h2>Access Control Rules</h2>
    
    <h3>Review Every "Any" Rule</h3>
    <p>Search your ruleset for "any" in the source, destination, or service fields. Each one is a potential security gap:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Source: Any</strong> — Who exactly should be able to reach this?</li>
      <li><strong>Destination: Any</strong> — Does this really need to go everywhere?</li>
      <li><strong>Service: Any</strong> — Can we limit this to specific ports?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Remove Stale Rules</h3>
    <p>That "temporary" rule from 2019? Still there. Set up a process to review rules quarterly and remove anything that's no longer needed. Most firewalls can show hit counts — rules with zero hits in 90 days are candidates for removal.</p>
    
    <h3>Order Matters</h3>
    <p>Firewall rules are processed top-to-bottom (usually). Put your most specific deny rules before broad permit rules. A common mistake: having a "permit any any" rule above more restrictive rules, making them useless.</p>

    <h2>Management Access</h2>
    
    <h3>Restrict Management to Specific IPs</h3>
    <p>Management interfaces (SSH, HTTPS, console) should only be accessible from designated management networks or jump boxes. Never from the internet. Never from the general user network.</p>
    
    <h3>Use Strong Authentication</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Complex passwords (16+ characters)</li>
      <li>MFA if supported</li>
      <li>RADIUS/TACACS+ for centralized auth and logging</li>
      <li>Individual accounts, not shared admin credentials</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Encrypt Management Traffic</h3>
    <p>Disable HTTP, Telnet, and other unencrypted management protocols. Use HTTPS and SSH only.</p>

    <h2>Logging & Monitoring</h2>
    
    <h3>Log Denied Traffic</h3>
    <p>At minimum, log all denied connections. This helps detect scanning, brute force attempts, and misconfigured applications.</p>
    
    <h3>Log Allowed Traffic (Selectively)</h3>
    <p>For critical rules (internet-facing services, admin access), enable logging even for allowed traffic. You want to know who's accessing what.</p>
    
    <h3>Send Logs Externally</h3>
    <p>Forward logs to a SIEM or syslog server. If someone compromises the firewall, local logs can be wiped. External logs survive.</p>

    <h2>Network Segmentation</h2>
    
    <p>Your firewall should do more than just sit at the edge. Internal segmentation limits lateral movement:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Servers in a DMZ</strong> — Web servers and other public-facing systems shouldn't be on the same network as internal resources</li>
      <li><strong>Separate user and server networks</strong> — A compromised workstation shouldn't have direct access to all servers</li>
      <li><strong>Isolate sensitive systems</strong> — Finance, HR, and backup systems deserve their own segments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Egress Filtering (The Forgotten Rule)</h2>
    
    <p>Most companies only filter inbound traffic. But controlling outbound (egress) traffic is equally important:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Block unnecessary outbound ports (do users really need outbound SSH?)</li>
      <li>Force web traffic through a proxy for inspection</li>
      <li>Block known malware domains at the firewall</li>
      <li>Restrict servers to only the outbound connections they need</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If malware can't call home, it can't exfiltrate data or receive commands.</p>

    <h2>Regular Maintenance</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firmware updates:</strong> Stay current on patches, especially security fixes</li>
      <li><strong>Config backups:</strong> Automated, regular backups stored securely</li>
      <li><strong>Rule reviews:</strong> Quarterly at minimum</li>
      <li><strong>Access reviews:</strong> Who has admin access? Do they still need it?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quick Wins</h2>
    
    <p>If you only do five things today:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Verify default deny is in place</li>
      <li>Restrict management access to specific IPs</li>
      <li>Search for and review all "any" rules</li>
      <li>Enable logging for denied traffic</li>
      <li>Block outbound traffic to known malware domains</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>These take an hour or two and significantly improve your security posture.</p>
