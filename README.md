Notes, checklists and experiments from doing security work in the real world.

Stuff you'll probably see here:
- security audit checklists and how-tos
- MSP/sysadmin-friendly ways to productize security work
- small tools, scripts and templates that came out of client work

Goal is simple: less theory, more “here’s what actually worked in production”.
