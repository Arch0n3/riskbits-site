    <h1 style="font-size: 36px; margin-bottom: 24px;">About RiskiBits</h1>
    
    <p>I'm a network security engineer with over 10 years in the field. I've done security audits, incident response, architecture reviews, and compliance work for companies ranging from 10-person startups to enterprises with thousands of employees.</p>
    
    <p>Most of my work has been with small and medium businesses — companies that need solid security but don't have the budget for a full security team or expensive consultants.</p>
    
    <h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>
    
    <p>I got tired of two things:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Fear-mongering security content</strong> — designed to scare people into buying expensive products</li>
      <li><strong>Enterprise-focused advice</strong> — that's completely impractical for a 50-person company</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>RiskiBits is my attempt to fix that. Practical, no-BS security advice for people who don't have unlimited budgets or dedicated security teams.</p>
    
    <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Articles</strong> — Actionable security guides focused on what actually prevents breaches</li>
      <li><strong>Templates</strong> — Ready-to-use documents I've refined over years of client work</li>
      <li><strong>No vendor shilling</strong> — I don't get paid to recommend products. When I mention tools, it's because they work.</li>
    </ul>
